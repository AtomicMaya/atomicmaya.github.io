  <p>"Well, this is new!" is probably one of the sentences going through your head right now, if you've been keeping track of this blog.</p>

  <p>And you would be entirely correct, as this is my first time collaborating with a number of industry peers to investigate what seems to be a sophisticated phishing kit, published by a threat actor we are uncertain about (possibly <strong>0ktapus</strong> or <strong>Scatter Swine</strong>), that we have in the meantime namednamed <strong><em>SecuriPhish</em></strong>.</p>

  <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>

  <h4 id="a-discovery-of-phishes">A discovery of phishes</h4>

  <p>All of this started a fateful <em>&lt;insert time of day here&gt;</em>, when one of my friends received a phishing email.</p>
  <p>This would be an ordinary everyday occurrence, had she not been using that email address for a singular service: the domain name registrar Namecheap.</p>
  <p>Did Namecheap get popped? Magic 8-ball says probably not.</p>
  <p>But Namecheap uses a service called SendGrid to send out emails, which is owned by Twilio, which was allegedly the victim of a breach on June 29th, 2022 (related article <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/28/twilio-june-data-breach" target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> here</a>, related Twilio investigation <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack" target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> here</a>).</p>
  <p>So although not a definite link, it is quite possible my friend's email address was sourced from that breach.</p>

  <div class="media-container">

  </div>

  <br/>
  <p>But that's besides the point.</p>

  <hr><br/>
  <h4 id="phishing-as">Who were they phishing as?</h4>
  <p>But Namecheap, or DHL (as in the above email screenshot), were not the only companies that were impersonated.</p>
  <p>In fact, there's so many that we may actually want to categorize them in a non-exhaustive list:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Entertainment</li>
    <ul>
      <li>iTunes</li>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Netflix</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Tech</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Aruba</li>
      <li>Hostinger</li>
      <li>Strato</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Cryptocurrency</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Ledger</li>
      <li>Metamask</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Banking</li>
    <ul>
      <li>UBS</li>
      <li>Banque Agricole</li>
      <li>Postbank</li>
      <li>BNP Paribas</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Postal Services</li>
    <ul>
      <li>DHL</li>
      <li>Deutsche Post</li>
      <li>UPS</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p>So, that is a lot of well-known names... <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="telescope" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png">ðŸ˜…</g-emoji></p>

  <p>And since the emails can <em>look</em> convincing, some people may be ensnared into the phishing campaign.</p>

  <p>I've been asked not to disclose the URL's and scans thereof at this time.</p>

  <hr><br/>
  <h4 id="phishing-for">What were they phishing for?</h4>
  <p>From what we've seen, the main target of these phishes involves the user logging into their account.</p>

  <p>This would point to an operation aiming to harvest credentials, and possibly benefit from the ever so frequent scourge that is password reuse between services.</p>

  <p>In the end, the key motivation to this kind of operation is usually to be able to take control of people's accounts and gain from it financially.</p>

  <hr><br/>
  <h4 id="how-phish">How the phish did it work?</h4>

  <p>So! This is where we get to the technical bits. (The part you've assumedly <em>all</em> been impatiently waiting for <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="telescope" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png">ðŸ˜‰</g-emoji>)</p>

  <p>Most of the affected domains have a redirect chain to reach a specific domain:</p>

  <markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>
```js
window.location.replace("https://$DOMAIN/STDWGuWIRi7Y2loN94MZzgjEiADRVnSiC90msq4aoQmOKFZay6ZuH3H5BpvcLh/")
```
  </markdown>

  <br/>
  <p>The domain, once more, isn't shared.</p>

  <p>The string that follows the domain is presumably either static or fully random. The case for the former would be to limit indexing and accidental discovery, and the latter would be to track connections to perform anti-analysis actions.</p>

  <h5 id="stage-1">Payload - Stage 1</h5>

  <p>This domain hosts a script which is the first stage in a multi-stage loader, shown below in a decompressed way:</p>

  <markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>
```js
var _0xc67e=["","split","0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ+/","slice","indexOf","","",".","pow","reduce","reverse","0"];
function _0xe53c(d,e,f){{ '{' }}
  var g=_0xc67e[2][_0xc67e[1]](_0xc67e[0]);
  var h=g[_0xc67e[3]](0,e);
  var i=g[_0xc67e[3]](0,f);
  var j=d[_0xc67e[1]](_0xc67e[0])[_0xc67e[10]]()[_0xc67e[9]](
    function(a,b,c){{ '{' }}
      if(h[_0xc67e[4]](b)!==-1)
        return a+=h[_0xc67e[4]](b)*(Math[_0xc67e[8]](e,c))
    {{ '}' }}
    ,0
  );
  var k=_0xc67e[0];
  while(j>0){{ '{' }}
    k=i[j%f]+k;
    j=(j-(j%f))/f
  {{ '}' }}
  return k||_0xc67e[11]
{{ '}' }}

eval(function(h,u,n,t,e,r){{ '{' }}
  r="";
  for(var i=0,len=h.length;i< len;i++){{ '{' }}
    var s="";
    while(h[i]!==n[e]){{ '{' }}
      s+=h[i];
      i++
    {{ '}' }}
    for(var j=0;j< n.length;j++)
      s=s.replace(new RegExp(n[j],"g"),j);
    r+=String.fromCharCode(_0xe53c(s,e,10)-t)
  {{ '}' }}
  return decodeURIComponent(escape(r))
{{ '}' }}("HrHTvrJHTvvJvTvrvHTvrJJTvvJrT /* elision */ rTvvvvT",93,"JrvHThdNm",45,4,28))
```

  <p>So... what the heck is this?</p>

  <p>Well it's obfuscated JavaScript! But beyond that it's an initial anti-analysis feature.</p>

  <p>Let's start from the top of the call stack, which is the anonymous <code>function (h,u,n,t,e,r)</code>. We instantly see that the result of the function is evaluated, which means it is probably a different obfuscated script (and as such needs to instantly be modified in order to avoid executing anything potentially malicious on our machine).</p>

  <markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces lineNumbers>
```js
eval(function(h,u,n,t,e,r){{ '{' }}
  r="";
  for(var i=0,len=h.length;i< len;i++){{ '{' }}
    var s="";
    while(h[i]!==n[e]){{ '{' }}
      s+=h[i];
      i++
    {{ '}' }}
    for(var j=0;j< n.length;j++)
      s=s.replace(new RegExp(n[j],"g"),j);
    r+=String.fromCharCode(_0xe53c(s,e,10)-t)
  {{ '}' }}
  return decodeURIComponent(escape(r))
{{ '}' }}("HrHTvrJHTvvJvTvrvHTvrJJTvvJrT /* elision */ rTvvvvT",93,"JrvHThdNm",45,4,28))
```
  </markdown>
  <br>

  <p>The string <code>r</code> defined at line 2 is the accumulator for the deobfuscated script.</p>
  <p>The function the iterates over the entire provided string, and fills the <code>s</code> buffer (line 4) up until it hits the character <code>'H'</code> (or <code>n[e]</code> a.k.a. <code>n[4]</code>), showing us what the delimiter is.</p>

  <p>The function then iterates over the <code>s</code> buffer, replacing the characters also found in the provided <code>n</code> string by the index value at which they are found.</p>

  <p>For the string <code>'vrJH'</code> we can then see the following progression:</p>

  <markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>
```txt
vrJH vr0H
vr0H v10H
v10H 210H
210H 2103
2103 2103
2103 2103
2103 2103
2103 2103
2103 2103
```
  </markdown>
  <br>

  <p>This final string is then injected into <code>_0xe53c</code>, a number to ASCII character code converter:</p>

  <markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces lineNumbers>
```js
function _0xe53c(d,e,f){{ '{' }}
  var g="0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ+/".split("");
  var h=g.slice(0,e);
  var i=g.slice(0,f);
  var j=d.split("").reverse().reduce(
    function(a,b,c){{ '{' }}
      if (h.indexOf(b)!==-1)
        return a+=h.indexOf(b)*(Math.pow(e,c))
      {{ '}' }},0
  );
  var k="";
  while(j>0){{ '{' }}
    k=i[j%f]+k;j=(j-(j%f))/f
  {{ '}' }}
  return k||"0"
{{ '}' }}
```
  </markdown>
  <br>

  <p>Let's break this down:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>g</code> is a character alphabet.</li>
    <li><code>h</code> is a slice of <code>g</code> based on <code>e</code>: <code>['0','1','2','3']</code></li>
    <li><code>i</code> is a slice of <code>g</code> based on <code>f</code>: <code>['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']</code></li>
    <li><code>j</code> takes every character in the provided string and check whether it is in <code>['0','1','2','3']</code> (<code>h</code>) works with a quaternary representation conversion (base 4).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That last bit wasn't really clear, so let's show the process that the code would use on the <code>vrJH</code> sequence defined earlier, which was initially converted to <code>2103</code>:</p>

  <markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>
```txt
0+=[0,1,2,3].indexOf(3)*Math.pow(4,0)       Add 3   (3*1)
3+=[0,1,2,3].indexOf(0)*Math.pow(4,1)       Add 0   (0*4)
3+=[0,1,2,3].indexOf(1)*Math.pow(4,2)       Add 16  (1*16)
19+=[0,1,2,3].indexOf(2)*Math.pow(4,3)      Add 128 (2*64)
Final value: 147
```
  </markdown>
  <br>

  <p>Okay, but that's just a single number, what happens next?</p>

  <p>Well, it gets an arbitrary 45 subtracted from it, then gets converted to ASCII text.</p>

  <p>So in finality our sequence looks like so:</p>

  <markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces>
```txt
Payload:    HrHTvrJHTvvJvTvrvHTvrJJTvvJrTvrrvTvrHJTvrvHTrJHrTvrrJTvrJvTvvJrTvrJHTrHHrTrHHrTvrrvTvrJJTvJHvTvvJJTvvJJTvrHJTrrrrTrrrvTvvvJT
Strip:      HrH | (T) | vrJH | (T) | vvJv | (T) | vrvH | (T) | vrJJ | (T) | vvJr | (T) | vrrv | (T) ...
Convert:    313 |       2103 |       2202 |       2123 |       2100 |       2201 |       2112 | ...

Pre-ASCII:   10 |        102 |        117 |        110 |         99 |        116 |        105 | ...
Post-ASCII:  \n |          f |          u |          n |          c |          t |          i | ...
```
  </markdown>
  <br>

  <p>... and we have the start of another function!</p>

  <h5 id="stage-2">Payload - Stage 2</h5>

  <p>The second stage was much longer, so I won't go posting walls of code here, but I will summarize what it does and how it works.</p>

  <p>This script is focused primarily on fingerprinting the browser and the underlying device, in order to complicate the life of people trying to analyze it.</p>
