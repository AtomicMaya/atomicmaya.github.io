  <p>I may have had the opportunity to take a one-week trip to South Korea, mostly subsidized by the University of Geneva and a few undisclosed partners.</p>
  <p>By which I mean, I had the opportunity, relished its existence as I had not been able to go there two years prior, and then subsequently went there.</p>

  <h4 id='day-0'>Day 0 - Travel</h4>
  <p>The first day was more two days merged into one very long day.</p>
  <p>The reason for this is we left Geneva Airport on November 5th at 10:00 AM, and arrived in Seoul on November 6th at 06:35 AM (Geneva time still), implying at least 20 hours of travel to arrive in Seoul, transiting through Saudi Arabia (which was not fantastic, see <a href='/post/2023/2023_02_17+gender-paradigm-shift' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> this blog post</a> to understand why).</p>
  <p>In Seoul, it was Sunday afternoon when we arrived, and we subsequently shuffled to our hotel, checked in, went for fried chicken and beer (a kind of new traditional dish) in a back alley, and then crashed for the night.</p>

  <p>The first "real" day in Seoul, we had some time to wander around the city, where I walked around the Northern side of the city.</p>

  <p>We then visited Asiance, an e-brand company implanted in the South-East Asia markets, which gave us some perspectives as to how the South-Eastern ecosystems work with regards to tech.</p>
