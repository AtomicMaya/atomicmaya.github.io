  <p>Yesterday, I gave a small talk about OSINT on the Gateway Discord Community !</p>

  <p>It had more to do with the steps involved in OSINT and their objectives, as well as various tools, reporting methods and -- most importantly -- some amateur tips that could've been of interest to the community.</p>

  <p>The people of the Gateway Community seemed to like it, so I might talk about it again some other day.</p>

  <p>Sadly, an OBS error made it so that the recording has been lost to the ages, but hopefully the things we've learned will stay engraved in the minds of all the participants.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, my slides are below and the actual presentation can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AtomicMaya/talks/raw/main/maya-boeckh%40gateway_OSINT.pptx" rel="noopener">here</a>. I guess you can fill in my exhuberant and overenergetic demeanor on top of it, maybe that'll work.</p>
