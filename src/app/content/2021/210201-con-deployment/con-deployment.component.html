  <p>Good news all around! I've managed to rope myself (quite consensually) into co-organizing a conference for rookies -- much like BeerCon2 in it's time. I've made my bed with Digital Overdose, a community I had the pleasure of joining last December, and the pleasure of offering some tutoring.</p>
  <p>One day I was super excited and discussing the future of the community and its administration, and I floated the idea of a conference, exclusively for rookie speakers. It was something that I'd wanted to do for a short while, but I frankly expected it to be shot down.<br/>It wasn't.</p>
  <p>The organising team is mostly comprised of <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mrs_skelli" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Mrs. Skelli</a> and myself.</p>
  <p>So after scoping out some mentors, some interesting topics, and getting some sense of how it would be organised, I set out on building the website for Digital Overdose Con (more on this <a target="_blank" href="/post/2021/2021_02_06+Building-DOs-Website">here</a>).</p>
