  <p>I've slowly -- over the many months of COVID -- been embedding myself in the InfoSec community, discussing many things and making many friends along the way !</p>
  <p>It came to me as a surprise today to be pinged on TMHC's (The Many Hats Club's) <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/infosec"><i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Discord server</a> one afternoon for something else than random discussion threading or shitposting.</p>
  <p>Someone was looking for some advice in relation to an upcoming talk they were possible giving, and someone else mentioned to them that I had just given a talk recently at BeerCon2. (<a target="_blank" href="/postx/2020/2020_11_02+I-gave-a-talk-at-BeerCon2">that story</a>)</p>
  
  <br/>
  <p>Since they were hesitant to ping me (understandable), I pinged them and we moved to Direct Messages to eventually set up a call to get better acquainted with one another and discuss their upcoming talk (which sounds very interesting)</p>
  <p>That call (which went on for about an hour and a half), albeit in my opinion quite successful, made me think that not everyone has the same mental approach to preparing for and giving a talk, and that my particular approach isn't really taken, although in my opinion closer and better suited to how I work as a hyperactive person.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>As such, I'd like to extend an open invitation to DM me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AtomicNicos"><i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i> Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/nicolas-boeckh"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i> LinkedIn</a> or Discord (@AtomicNicos#1404) if you want me to "mentor" you (basically discussing your topic, giving you some clues to storyboard your talk, where and how to find resources, performing a few dry-runs, helping you cope with stress, etc.), as I'd really like to give back to the community the care and dedication that my mentors had given to me during BeerCon2, and so many interesting voices around topics deserve to have the opportunity to be heard.</p>
