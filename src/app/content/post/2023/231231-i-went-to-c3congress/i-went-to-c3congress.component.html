  <p>I've really started enjoying going to various Chaos/Chaos-adjacent events, something which - for me - started in 2022 with MayContainHackers (styled "MCH", a story you can read <a href='/post/2022/2022_07_29%2Bheading-to-Amsterdam-and-going-to-MCH' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-link"></em> here</a>), then continued last summer when I went to C3Camp (read that story <a href='/post/2023/2023_08_21%2Bi-went-to-c3camp' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-link"></em> here</a>).</p>

  <p>As such, when the opportunity presented itself for me to head out to 37c3 (or the 37th Chaos Communication Congress), between Christmas and New Year, I didn't hesitate.</p>

  <p>Now, when I was doing the planning for the trip, I was still living in Geneva, and hadn't yet moved to Zürich.</p>

  <p>So due to this quite suboptimal planning, all the tickets I had booked were going via Geneva, which meant I was travelling on the 26th of December and on the 31st, to and from Hamburg by no means on the shortest path possible.</p>

  <p>Additionally, given my uncomfortable jout with COVID at Camp, I had resolved to be as careful as possible for the duration of the event, which was held indoors.</p>

  <p>Upon making it to Hamburg and checking into my hotel, I went and met up with <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/_nynan" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Alana</a>, with whom I drank a few beers whilst we waited for a few of our friends (Bonzi and Jules) to show up.</p>

  <p>After bidding them adieu, I headed back to the hotel, extremely excited for the first day of 37c3.</p>

  <h4 id="day-1">Day 1</h4>

  <p>The day kicked off with me linking up again with the crew and heading in to the Congress Center, where a line had formed.</p>

  <p>I often describe lines at conference's - when I describe them - as a hellish experience (see any of my posts about DEFCON), but this one was actually quite organized and quick. There were even masks and COVID tests freely available, so I grabbed a few for the next few days.</p>

  <p><em>A short sidebar, but even though hackers are portrayed as really smart people, the amount of people not caring about infectiousness was quite high (around 85%).</em></p>

  <p>I also visited a few of the spaces and the villages, before tempting myself into becoming a ChaosPost delivery person, which basically entails the delivery - by any means possible - of event postcards to attendees.</p>

  <p>This job isn't a typical Chaos Angel job (official volunteers), but is nonetheless fun and rewarding!</p>

  <p>One of these deliveries brought me to where the folks from the Shark Corner (the official <a href='https://glauca.digital' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> Glauca Digital</a> Discord), where I met <a target="_blank" href="https://frogs.lgbt/@alyx" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-mastodon"></em> Alyx</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://coolmathgam.es/@erin" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-mastodon"></em> Erin</a> (the latter of which I had some Chaos Post for).</p>

  <p>We got to chatting and ended up hanging out for most of 37c3.</p>

  <h4 id="day-2">Day 2</h4>

  <p>I met back up with Alyx and Erin, and to our troupe was added <a target="_blank" href="https://tech.lgbt/@ashlynbutgay" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-mastodon"></em> Ashlyn</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://eldritch.cafe/@i3le" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-mastodon"></em> Isa</a>.</p>

  <p>Day 2 also was the day to acquire event merch, and whilst I was in line I got a Telegram message from one of my old university classmates (no, not from when I was at University of Geneva, but rather before that, back when I went to EPFL), who through some fun coincidence was also present at 37c3. Needless to say, time had passed, <em>changes</em> had occured, and <em>things</em> had happened to both of us, that we needed a few minutes to reacclimate.</p>

  <p>Beyond that, the merch line had a very fun "end of the line" sign, which was quite funny!</p>

    <span><em>The "END OF QUEUE" sign.</em></span>
  </div>

  <p>Later that day, I hung out at <a href='https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/c3soft/' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> c3soft</a>, where <a target="_blank" href="https://ck.katzen.cafe/@aprl" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-mastodon"></em> April</a> gave my Blåhaj a makeover session (the very first one of 37c3, allegedly).</p>

  <p>I then sent some postcards to friends and strangers alike via ChaosPost, including one to <a target="_blank" href="https://chaos.social/@quinn" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-mastodon"></em> Quinn</a> as fae had posted the following to fedi:</p>

  </div>

  <p>I then spent some time hanging out at <a href='https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/entropolis/' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> Entropolis</a> whilst still "on the job" delivering Chaos Post, including one of the more run-around deliveries which involved finding someone's blog, then finding their email address and writing an email to ensure delivery.</p>

  <div class="media-container">

    <span><em>The email I sent.</em></span>
  </div>

  <p>Before moving on, a queer meetup was planned, where I arrived early and had the dubious honor of acting like a beacon for the meetup.</p>

  <br/>

  <p>That evening, I had planned to head to a party on the Chaos Trawler, but the time escaped me, and that trawler had sailed.</p>

  <p>However, I heard on the grapevine that there was a secret bathroom rave to happen, also known as the Maskenbal.</p>

  <p>It lasted for several hours, and we ended up leaving right after <a target="_blank" href="https://chaos.social/@NikTheDusky" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-mastodon"></em> Nik</a>'s set, which was an absolute banger.</p>

  </div>

  <h4 id="day-3">Day 3</h4>

  <p>The third day was split between a late start, some more Chaos Post deliveries, and hanging out at <a href='https://www.haecksen.org' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> Haecksen</a> after an invite to drink tea was posted by <a target="_blank" href="https://chaos.social/@Deanna" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-mastodon"></em> Deanna</a>.</p>

  <p>I completed a few angel shifts, primarily focused on watching doors, all to grind for an Angel Shirt, before hanging out at <a href='https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/milliways/' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> Milliways</a> (or more accurately Freeside), where I met up with May (whoms't I'd hung out with at SteelCon and BSides London)</p>

  <p>Due to an (un)fortunate series of shenanigans, Alyx and myself ended up organizing a bit of a "joke assembly", namely a <a href='https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/event/meowing-session/' target="_blank"><em class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></em> "Meowing Session"</a> (it's exactly what it sounds like). This was a good accompaniment to other (not-so-official) assemblies such as the "serve the owl, save your streak" pre-midnight assembly:</p>

  <div class="media-container">

  </div>

  <h4 id="day-4">Day 4</h4>

  <p>The last day was a bit less loaded, with us making it in time for the aforementioned assembly.</p>

  <p>I then did a shift, and helped out with teardown at the NOC, which involved folding a lot of Ethernet cables under the supervision of the cable queen, RQ.</p>

  <p>Once that was done, the remaining group of new friends headed off for some food and reminisced whilst sitting in front of of the remaining carcass of the Congress Center.</p>

  <p>All that was left was to get back home, and to continue testing to make sure I hadn't caught COVID. I also somehow left Hamburg with one more sharks than I had arrived with, which was interesting an interesting development.</p>
