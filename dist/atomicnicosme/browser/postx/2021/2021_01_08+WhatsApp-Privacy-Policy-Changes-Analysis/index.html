Whereas just 50 years ago one had to call an operator to be able to make a transatlantic call (or phreak it), we now live in a world where a great majority of people from varying ages posess smart-devices, and a stable Internet connection (at least in the "Western" world), and regularly communicate with these devices with one another.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">*Record Scratch* <i _ngcontent-sc32="">freeze frame</i>: "So, you're probably wondering how we got here".</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">Well, most sources place the emergence of smartphones in the mid to late 2000's, but what really kicked off their widespread use were touchscreens (such as the LG Prada in 2006 or the iPhone in 2007). Parallel to this was the emergence of 3G networking, allowing people to carry the power of the Internet in their pockets (but somehow collectively get stupider).</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">Fast-forward to 2009, and WhatsApp emerges. The concept of the service was simple: to show "statuses next to individual names of people". Fast-forward to 2014, and WhatsApp is valued at $1.5 Billion. That same year, Facebook acquires WhatsApp, making it a part of the Facebook family of companies. Nowadays, WhatsApp has more than 1 billion users and is a cornerstone of modern communication capabilities (text, phone, video), especially relevant during a pandemic (COVID-19) for people to stay in touch.</p><br _ngcontent-sc32=""><h4 _ngcontent-sc32="" id="defense-condition">Defense Condition 1</h4><p _ngcontent-sc32="">However, a few days ago, on Jan. 4th 2021, WhatsApp announced changes in their privacy policy (from <a _ngcontent-sc32="" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210112155928/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy/revisions/20191219">the last version (Dec. 19th, 2019 | archived Jan. 12th, 2021)</a> to <a _ngcontent-sc32="" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210111005608/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy">the current version (Jan. 4th, 2021 | archived Jan. 11th, 2021)</a>), as well as a pretty clear cut message: "Accept, or GTFO".</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">The change could be seen in a singular modification, which was the removal of the sentence <em _ngcontent-sc32="" style="color:#ff0882;">"Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA."</em></p><h5 _ngcontent-sc32=""><em _ngcontent-sc32="">"Information we collect"</em></h5><p _ngcontent-sc32="">One of the first things that jumped out was that WhatsApp originally asked for a phone number, some basic information as well as also require that users "provide us [WhatsApp] with the phone numbers in your mobile address book on a regular basis", without any additional information as to the modalities of such exchanges of information (a pattern that will seem familiar by the end of this post), as seen in <a _ngcontent-sc32="" routerlink="." fragment="figure-1" href="/postx/2021/2021_01_08%2BWhatsApp-Privacy-Policy-Changes-Analysis#figure-1">Fig. 1</a>.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">With the new policy change, WhatsApp seems to raise the ambiguity of the problem, still wanting uploads but also "managing the information in a way that ensures those contacts cannot be identified by us [WhatsApp]", which is ridiculous because a phone number is already enough PII (Personally Identifiable Information) to partially identify someone (see <a _ngcontent-sc32="" routerlink="." fragment="figure-2" href="/postx/2021/2021_01_08%2BWhatsApp-Privacy-Policy-Changes-Analysis#figure-2">Fig. 2</a>).</p><div _ngcontent-sc32="" id="figure-1" class="d-flex flex-column"><div _ngcontent-sc32="" class="media-container"><img _ngcontent-sc32="" max-width="70%" src="/assets/images/2021/whatsapp-privacy-policy/whatsapp-accnt-info-original.png" alt="The original privacy policy with the relevant passage underlined."></div><span _ngcontent-sc32="" class="mx-auto small">Fig. 1: The original data collected.</span></div><div _ngcontent-sc32="" id="figure-2" class="d-flex flex-column"><div _ngcontent-sc32="" class="media-container"><img _ngcontent-sc32="" max-width="70%" src="/assets/images/2021/whatsapp-privacy-policy/whatsapp-accnt-info-new.png" alt="The new privacy policy with the relevant passage underlined."></div><div _ngcontent-sc32="" class="media-container"><img _ngcontent-sc32="" max-width="70%" src="/assets/images/2021/whatsapp-privacy-policy/whatsapp-accnt-info-new-2.png" alt="The new privacy policy with the relevant passage underlined."></div><span _ngcontent-sc32="" class="mx-auto small">Fig. 2: The data collected under the new policy.</span></div><br _ngcontent-sc32=""><p _ngcontent-sc32="">But this is only the tip of the iceberg, and also the only one where WhatsApp bothers to ask for one's informed consent (which one gives by blindly pressing <em _ngcontent-sc32="">"I agree"</em>).</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">When it comes to <em _ngcontent-sc32="">Automatically Collected Information</em>, we get into muddier waters.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">A part of that is the <em _ngcontent-sc32="">Usage and Log Information</em> section, wherein WhatsApp used to only collect <em _ngcontent-sc32="">"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information"</em> (see <a _ngcontent-sc32="" routerlink="." fragment="figure-3" href="/postx/2021/2021_01_08%2BWhatsApp-Privacy-Policy-Changes-Analysis#figure-3">Fig. 3</a>).</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">In the new iteration WhatsApp collects information <em _ngcontent-sc32="">"<b _ngcontent-sc32="" style="color:#ff0882;">like</b> service-related, diagnostic, and performance information."</em>, and then proceed to give some precise examples (such as <em _ngcontent-sc32="">"the time, frequency, and duration of [one's] activities"</em>, or <em _ngcontent-sc32="">"log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports"</em>). The word <em _ngcontent-sc32="">like</em> in this context is deeply disturbing (to me, again: not a lawyer), because it seems to me that it entails that it is an example (and thus a logical subset) of the types of information WhatsApp collects, which, in addition to the log files, can be a serious breach of users' privacy. We yet again do not know the uses for all of the information that is collected.

An important notion of GDPR that seems to not be entirely understood is that it doesn't stop companies from processing users data, but rather from sharing it with third parties for them to process it for most business purposes.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">Whether inside or outside the EAA, Facebook can process information collected by WhatsApp (as Facebook owns WhatsApp) for it's own analytics and advertising scheme (and more).</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">It comes down potentially as a way to fingerprint users, but could be used for darker prospects, such as to furnish 'shadow profiles' which are profiles of people containing information they themselves haven't necessarily furnished, such as information handed over by data brokers, as <a _ngcontent-sc32="" target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/facebook-shadow-profiles-hearing-lujan-zuckerberg/?guccounter=1">this article covering Mark Zuckerberg's (CEO of Facebook) testimony before the US Congress</a> shows us.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">These 'shadow profiles' are something that Facebook curates about people on <b _ngcontent-sc32="">and off</b> of the platform, gleefully breaking the requirement for informed consent (or at least a <em _ngcontent-sc32="">"I agree without having read the terms and conditions"</em> kind of consent) with information of how frequently users interact outside of Facebook. These 'shadow profiles' can potentially then be used to determine preferences and potentially display ads that they were paid to, or other more nefarious 'Big Brother'-ly purposes (without actually requiring the user to be logged in or even posess a Facebook account).</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">Think from the following what you will, but it seems that Facebook has recently been actively setting aside considerable amounts of money specifically for GDPR fines (as seen in <a _ngcontent-sc32="" target="_blank" href="https://iapp.org/news/a/facebook-bracing-for-gdpr-fines/">this Dec. 2020 article</a>, Facebook has allegedly put aside 302 Million Euros for that purpose).</p><br _ngcontent-sc32=""><h4 _ngcontent-sc32="" id="shot-chaser">Shot!

The Signal Protocol is being constantly vetted and is among the most secure end-to-end encryption protocols currently in existence. As for the concerns of privacy enthusiasts, Signal only require one thing from their users: their phone number.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">Telegram on the other hand is owned by "Telegram Messenger Inc." and is partially open-source: the client is fully-open source but the encryption system (MTProto) is not. This has led to a bit of criticism because it is impossible to verify the security of the encryption protocol. Additionally, Telegram's chats <span _ngcontent-sc32="" style="color:#ff0882;">are not end-to-end encrypted by default, but are still encrypted during transit</span>. People should use the "Secret Chat" feature to have a fully end-to-end encrypted chat. </p><br _ngcontent-sc32=""><h4 _ngcontent-sc32="" id="my-own-take">My own take on the matter</h4><p _ngcontent-sc32="">I have personally been wary of Facebook for a while now, having closed my accounts within the ecosystem in 2014. I have so far maintained a WhatsApp account but am planning on deplatforming before Feb. 8th 2021.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">I also have Signal and Telegram accounts that I use to stay in touch with friends, as well as a presence within the Keybase, Riot and Wire platforms.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">My own recommendation would be to start migrating work, recreational and class groups away from the platform, so as to be as secure and as inclusive as those that desire their privacy to be respected as possible.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">I realize that it may be or seem complicated to convince friends, colleagues, children, parents and grandparents to migrate to Signal or Telegram, when they've spent the better part of the last 4-5 years using WhatsApp, and it would be especially complicated to help people migrate, since we are still living in a pandemic.</p><p _ngcontent-sc32="">Thankfully, the Internet has it's share of kind strangers, and people such as Forbes' Senior Cybersecurity Contributor <a _ngcontent-sc32="" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/KateOflaherty"><i _ngcontent-sc32="" class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i> Kate O'Flaherty</a> have published guides to migrate from one platform to another, for example <a _ngcontent-sc32="" target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2021/01/11/how-to-use-signal-the-awesome-whatsapp-alternative/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=4396431781&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesTechTwitter&amp;sh=66f717d7324b">this guide</a> on how to use and migrate from one to the other.</p><br _ngcontent-sc32=""></div></app-post-body></app-whatsapp-privacy-policy-analysis><!----><div _ngcontent-sc89=""><span _ngcontent-sc89=""></span><br _ngcontent-sc89=""></div></div><div _ngcontent-sc89="" class="sidebar"><app-sidebar _ngcontent-sc89="" _nghost-sc88=""><app-socials _ngcontent-sc88="" _nghost-sc85=""><h4 _ngcontent-sc85="">~$ Find me here</h4><div _ngcontent-sc85="" class="center d-flex flex-row justify-content-center flex-wrap"><div _ngcontent-sc85="" class="mx-2"><a _ngcontent-sc85="" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AtomicNicos"><i _ngcontent-sc85="" class="fab fa-twitter-square fa-2x"></i></a></div>â€‹ <div _ngcontent-sc85="" class="mx-2"><a _ngcontent-sc85="" target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/nicolas-boeckh"><i _ngcontent-sc85="" class="fab fa-linkedin fa-2x"></i></a></div>â€‹ <div _ngcontent-sc85="" class="mx-2"><a _ngcontent-sc85="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AtomicNicos"><i _ngcontent-sc85="" class="fab fa-github-square fa-2x"></i></a></div>â€‹ <div _ngcontent-sc85="" class="mx-2"><a _ngcontent-sc85="" target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.unige.ch/Nicolas.Boeckh"><i _ngcontent-sc85="" class="fab fa-gitlab fa-2x"></i></a></div>â€‹
