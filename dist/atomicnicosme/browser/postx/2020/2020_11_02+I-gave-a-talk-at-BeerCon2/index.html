InfoSec Happy Hour.</p><p>Originally, I felt I would be quite out of place joining that meetup, and quite heftily refused. A short while later though, I -- whilst inebriated, said I would at least partake in the experience once.</p><p>And that is how I came to be a card-holding (not really) regular member of the InfoSec Happy Hour crew !</p><br><h4 id="how-did-i-get-involved-in-this">How did I get involved in this ?</h4><p>Fast-forward to mid/late September, COVID-19 is rampant, everything is more-or-less shutdown, and many conventions with rookie speaker tracks have decided to cancel (because -- allegedly -- no one wants to attend virtual conferences).</p><p>All the while, after being de<strong>liver</strong>ed from my apprehensions in joining the Happy Hour gang, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheBeerFarmers" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> The Beer Farmers</a> announce they will be having a second iteration of their convention, the infamous BeerCon, aptly named <em>BeerCon2: Rise of the Rookie</em>.</p><div class="media-container py-2"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoCsSa2mjcU" width="560" height="315" title="BeerCon2 Intro Video"></iframe></div><p>That tagline is also the key selling point ? The only people that are allowed to speak there this time around are rookie speakers ! (ie. people who've never spoken anywhere before).</p><p>After some nudging in the first few days (done to me, not by me), I submit a CFP titled "Securely storing and transmitting information on mobile/IoT devices: A story in development" (which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A7owRWBNLkjhWL2H9BscVh87QcJ08Wmq/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p><p>A week or two pass by, and I get the answer !

So I time myself saying the things, and I manage to cram in 47 slides.</p><br><h4 id="the-many-averted-fuckups">The many averted fuckups.</h4><p>The multitude of positive things that happened at and emanated from BeerCon2 is mostly due to the mentors.</p><p>Since we were all rookie speakers, 5 seasoned speakers had volunteered their time and energy to mentor us, and help us with our presentations.</p><p>The names of these MVP's are:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RoseSecOps" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Zoë Rose</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/coffee_fueled" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> James Bore</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ClaireTills" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Claire Tills</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/davewj" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Dave McKenzie</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/safesecs" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Sam Humphries</a></li></ul><p>Speaking for myself, I was told that there was some content I could potentially cut from the presentation, and that a few visual details to be added or amended could make the presentation become even better.</p><p>Aside from the mentors, us speakers banded together to preview each others talks and -- most importantly -- to practice them.</p><p>On the side, I'd taken the opportunity to ask a few people their opinions on my talk to gain an outside view on it, notably:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RayRedacted" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Ray [REDACTED]</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/5w0rdfish" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Chrissy Morgan</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheCyberViking" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Dean</a></li></ul><p>In hindsight, I would've had a lot more issues giving my talk in the alloted time if I hadn't gone through the ringer a few times, gained my footing and cut a bit of content left and right.</p><h4 id="the-big-day-s">The big day(s).</h4><p>So, along comes Thursday the 29th of October, and I'm scheduled to deliver my talk at 12:50 local time.</p><p>I take all of my stuff (webcam, microphone, laptop, etc.) and bring it with me to university, where I'd planned to give my talk from.</p><p>I arrive there a few minutes before the opening keynote, and then start watching it from the comfort of my desk, slightly incredulous that I'm going to be a part of this !</p><p>Then the first talk -- titled "DevOps and Dragons: A guide to working differently through fantasy roleplay" -- hits, where <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ZSlater93" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Zak Slater</a> goes into detail as to how aspects of LARPing (aka. Live-Action Role-Playing) can be found in incident simulations, which really bluffs me !<br>Except it also scares me. Because I'd seen that high quality of a talk, I was suddenly afraid of how I would perform, and I start getting all jittery.</p><p>Right after that, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/juan_spinel" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Juan Spinel</a> does a deep dive on "GDPR, The Good intentions, The Bad Implementations &amp; the Ugly Loopholes". Yet another fantastic talk, and my nerves don't subside.</p><p>Surely that couldn't be a constant for the convention right ? Surely I wouldn't be the only one feeling insecure about their talk ? Next up was <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/yellowcap_ghost" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Ben Ellis</a>.<br>I knew from our runs together that he too was stressed. Although at the beginning his nerves did show, he steeled them and blasted it out of the park in his talk on how to grind Tokyo -- the capital of convenience -- to a halt in "Tokyo Takedown: How 10 seconds can change the world?"</p><p>Whilst <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheBeerFarmers" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> The Beer Farmers</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/davewj" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Dave McKenzie</a> hashed out war stories, I got into the waiting room, prepared to meet my fate.<br>My jitters had not subsided, and I was really stressed.</p><p>In the waiting room, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/lennaert89" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Lennaert</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ddsgerard" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> Gerard</a>, acting as roadies for BeerCon2, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/coffee_fueled" rel="noopener"><em class="fab fa-twitter-square"></em> James</a> were all there to help me calm down.<br>Then my time was at hand.</p><br><p>I start out quite stressed, going through a portion of my talk before feeling the sense of familiarity that came with my knowing it.</p><p>I cut some content in the middle and finish in about 28 minutes, get one or two questions answered and then it was finally over.<br>A sense of relief washes over me: I'd done it.</p><p>You can see for yourself here:</p><div class="media-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o1absxAzRjY" width="560" height="315" title="My BeerCon 2 talk"></iframe></div><br><p>I've chosen to make the slides available to everyone <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AtomicNicos/talks/raw/main/nicolas-boeckh%40beercon-2.pptx" rel="noopener">here</a>.
