the flight was mostly uneventful, but i did manage to catch some nice pictures at Schiphol Airport.</p><div class="media-container"><img src="https://pixels.catgirl.global/fileserver/01M9BS950EGEARRAT0ZE507DSG/attachment/original/01K38QCKPZ3TRMKPA6HJXY8EB1.jpeg" alt="picture of the waiting area at one of Schiphol's terminal D gates (D43).                             
there are no entities present, giving the entire space a liminal spaces vibe, especially as the area is very clean and neatly organized.                                                 
the sun is shining into the waiting area bay, but only the diffuse reflections can be seen from the inside, adding to the very light diffuse lighting from the ceiling panels.
